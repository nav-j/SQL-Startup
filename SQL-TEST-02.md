---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Practice all major **SQL topics** with one complete example:
- Table creation  
- Insertion  
- Filtering (WHERE, AND, OR, NOT)  
- Operators  
- Sorting  
- Aggregate Functions

## ðŸ§± Step 1: Create Tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DeptID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    DeptName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT,
    Salary INT,
    Experience INT,
    City VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID)
);
````

---

## ðŸ“¥ Step 2: Insert Data

```sql
INSERT INTO Departments (DeptName) VALUES
('HR'), ('IT'), ('Finance'), ('Marketing');

INSERT INTO Employees (Name, DepartmentID, Salary, Experience, City)
VALUES
('Ravi', 1, 40000, 3, 'Delhi'),
('Priya', 2, 55000, 5, 'Mumbai'),
('Anil', 3, 60000, 4, 'Bangalore'),
