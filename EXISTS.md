# SQL Task â€“ Using EXISTS

This task helps you understand how to use the **`EXISTS`** operator in MySQL.  
`EXISTS` is used to test whether a subquery returns any record â€” it returns **TRUE** if the subquery has at least one matching row.

### âœ… **Solution**

```sql
SELECT Name, DepartmentID, Salary
FROM Employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Departments d
    WHERE d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
);
````

### ðŸ“Š **Expected Output**

| Name   | DepartmentID | Salary |
| ------ | ------------ | ------ |
| Ramesh | 101          | 40000  |
| Priya  | 102          | 55000  |
| Anil   | 103          | 60000  |
| Neha   | 102          | 45000  |
| Meena  | 102          | 70000  |

*(Suresh is excluded because DepartmentID = 104 does not exist in the Departments table.)*

---

## ðŸ§  **Task 2 (Bonus)**

Display all departments that **have at least one employee** in the Employees table.

```sql
SELECT DepartmentName
FROM Departments d
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Employees e

);
```

| DepartmentName |
| -------------- |
| HR             |
| IT             |
| Finance        |
